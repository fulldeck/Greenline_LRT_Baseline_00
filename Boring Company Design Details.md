What is the ridership capacity of Loop?
Loop is targeting 4,000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h) for each Main Artery Tunnel.  
If a second tunnel is added below the first, this value doubles.

What's Loop?

Loop is a high-speed underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported via compatible Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) at up to 155 miles per hour.  TBC currently uses Tesla Model Xs, modified with alignment wheels and, for certain projects, an extended chassis to accommodate up to 16 passengers. 



How is Loop different from a subway?
Loop is an “express” public transportation system and more resembles an underground highway than a subway system.  Through the use of a Main Artery Tunnel with side tunnels for entry/exit, passengers travel directly to their final destination without stopping. 

As an example, if a train-line had 100 stops, the train would typically stop at each one, so the trip from Stop 1 to Stop 100 would be long.  For Loop, passengers would travel directly from Stop 1 to Stop 100 without stopping at the intermediate stations.  

Equivalently, a Loop vehicle’s average speed is close to its maximum speed, while a train’s average speed is much less than its maximum speed.  A subway car might be capable of traveling 65 mph, but its average speed might be 20 mph, decreasing further as more intermediate stations are added.

Additionally, autonomous electric vehicles are generally faster than conventional subway cars (150 mph vs. 65 mph), and, because of Loop’s architecture of high-quantity, small-footprint stations (see next question), Loop can get passengers physically closer to their final desired destination. 




How does Loop avoid congestion at entry/exit points?

Unlike a subway, there is no practical upper limit to the number of stations that can be built along the tunnel route, as stations can be as small as two parking spaces. 

The electric vehicles descend into a "spur" or side tunnel before quickly merging into a Main Artery Tunnel. Since stations require such a small footprint, they can be easily integrated in busy city-centers, parking garages, and residential communities. The high density of stations will help reduce congestion by distributing traffic across many access points and by providing more convenient entry and exit locations. At the same time, larger stations can be built to increase ridership capacity to a specific central location.

There is also no practical upper limit on the number of layers of tunnels, allowing the Loop system itself to always have capacity available to service each station.
