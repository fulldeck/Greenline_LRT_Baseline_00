Good day @everyone 

I have been watching Elon and his [Boring Company](www.boringcompany.com) for the last year.  Elons’s goal was to solve the [“Soul Destroying” traffic problem](https://www.theloop.ca/elon-musk-thinks-hes-solved-our-soul-destroying-traffic-problem/).

Elon’s concept is to construct tunnels underground.  To make these tunnels feasible they must be cost affective and be better for the citizens than other modes of transportation.  Elon has set out to build such a solution.

Interestingly in Calgary we are working to build a new LTR line; [The  GreenLine LRT](http://bit.ly/2m2TDRi).  I say this line is NEW because it won’t connect to the existing LRT, wont have the rolling stock, etc etc, so it just new.

My idea is to compare our Greenline LRT with the Boring Company's tunnels and see if there is a case to be made that a Boring Tunnel solution would be less capital intensive, more effective as a transit transportation solution, have a lower operational cost, etc.

Two important goals for starting a green field project: 
1. Don’t set the bar such that no incremental benefit can be derived from the project.
2. Why settle for good enough when better is possible.

So the 2 main goals of this project, which have been lifted from the [Chicago Infrastructure RFP](http://bit.ly/2lVDjBF) for the O’Hare to Downtown transit project, are as follows:
1. Costs half the price of existing transit options
2. Goes twice as fast

My ask of the community is... I would like some help.  @everyone 

The technical goals of this project are:
- Construct a [SUMO - **S**imulation of **U**rban **MO**bility](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/) simulation/framework of the Boring Tunnel concept and see if there are any road blocks, *<-pun* :wink: that need to be considered.
- Find any individuals what would be interested in contributing some time to completing this SUMO project.
- Present the SUMO framework to community leaders and solicit their interest in learning more. 
- Get this project started ASAP because the RFI for the LRT line went out last week, and if there is a viable option with the Boring Company tunnels, I will need to start selling it to community leaders soon.
- Have some fun figuring this out and presenting what has been learned in the process.
- **The primary goal is to model the Boring Tunnel in SUMO and see if the there are advantages over the Calgary LRT being planned and built. (This LRT was planned in 1985!).**

Next Ask:  Who wants to be on my Team? @everyone 

I would like to present these findings to the [CUTA/UITP International Rail Forum for North America](http://bit.ly/2kiBsql) presentations NOVEMBER 9 2019, in Calgary. 

I have already signed up as a team (currently a one-man team), to present at the CUTA/UITP presentations.

The presentation would show the team's findings and would ideally illustrate a viable alternative to the LRT plan. The presentation would outline The Boring Company’s tunnel advantages over the LRT in the following areas:
- Speed (Travel Time)
- Operation Cost
- Capital Cost 
- Define the benefits of a mainline and branches for stops 
- Flexibility in 3 main areas:
  - Use the tunnels for autonomous vehicles in the future
  - use the PODs for neighbourhood routes and high speed tunnel travel
  - use the PODS for disability taxi service during non-peak hours.

BTW, there is a transit problem given to each team, 6 weeks before the CUTA/UITP conference. Each team will attempt a solution  to this problem and then present the results.
