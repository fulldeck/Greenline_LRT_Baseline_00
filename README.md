Good day @everyone 

I have been watching Elon and his Boring Company for the last year.  www.boringcompany.com  Elons’s goal was to solve the “soul destroying” traffic problem.  https://www.theloop.ca/elon-musk-thinks-hes-solved-our-soul-destroying-traffic-problem/

Elon’s concept is to construct tunnels underground.  To make tunnels feasible they must be cost affective and be better for the citizens than other modes of transportation.  Elon set out to be build such a solution.

Interestingly in Calgary we are working to build a new LTR line, GreenLine LRT http://bit.ly/2m2TDRi.  I say this line is NEW because it won’t connect to the existing LRT, wont have the rolling stock, etc etc, so it just new.

My thought was to compare our Greenline LRT with the Elon’s Boring Company tunnels and see if there is a case to be made that a Boring Tunnel solution would be less capital intensive, more effective as a transit transportation solution, move more capability, operational cost less, etc.

Two things came to mind for me when setting goals for a green field project, 1. Don’t set the bar such that no incremental benefit is derived from the project and 2. Why settle for good enough when better is possible.

So my two goals are, which I lifted from the Chicago Infrastructure RFP for the O’Hare to Downtown http://bit.ly/2lVDjBF transit project;
1.    Costs half the price of existing transit options
2.    Goes twice as fast


My ask of this Channel is, I would like some help.  @everyone 

I would like to construct a SUMO framework of the Boring Tunnel concept and see if there are any road blocks, <-pun :wink: that need to be considered.  I would like to work with any individuals what would like to contribute some time to completing this SUMO framework.
I would like to present the SUMO framework to community leaders and solicit their interest in learning more. 
I would like to this ASAP because the RFI for the LRT line went out last week, and if there is a viable option with the Boring Company tunnels I need to start selling it to community leaders.
I would like to have some fun figuring this out and presenting what I learned in the process.
The goal is to model the Boring Tunnel in SUMO and see if the there are advantages over the LRT being planned and built.  This LRT was planned in 1985.
Next Ask;  Who wants to be on my Team? @everyone 

I would then like to present these finding to the CUTA/UITP International Rail Forum for North America presentations NOVEMBER 9 2019 In Calgary, http://bit.ly/2kiBsql

I have signed up as a Team, without a Team, to present at the “CUTA/UITP International Rail Forum for North America presentations” on Saturday. 

The presentation would show the Teams’ finding. The presentation would present an alternative to the LRT plan.  The presentation would outline the following;
Define the Boring Company’s advantages.
•    Speed (Travel Time)
•    Operation Cost
•    Capital Cost 
•    Define the benefits of a mainline and branches for stops 
•    Flexibility; ie Use the tunnels for autonomous vehicles in the future
•    Flexibility; ie use the PODs for neighbourhood routes and high speed tunnel travel
•    Flexibility; ie use the PODS for disability taxi service during non-peak hours.

BTW there is Transit problem given to Teams 6 weeks before the event to work on and present the results.
